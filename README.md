Maetrox - Multi-directional 2D game.

How to compile:
	You need to have SDL installed, specifically the image, mixer, and ttf modules.
	
	Simply run the 'configure' shell script then type 'make'. A binary named 'game' will be created.

To-do:
  * Multi-directional player sprite (finished)
  * Player vs wall collision detection (partial, will re-work next)
  * Remove those nasty textures
  * Walking animations (finished, rough. Will clean up shortly)
  * Wall collision sounds
  * Networking support
  * Chat window, speech.

Textures:
 * Player textures done by iceblue007 (deviantart)
 * Ground textures, so far, done by me.

Outline from Parallel Realities SDL tut #7. Code rearranged for my needs,
and built upon.

This software is released under the LGPLv2+, and is not shipped with ANY 
KIND of warranty.

Have fun!
