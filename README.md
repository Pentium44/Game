Simple type of multi-directional 2D game.
To-do:
  * Multi-directional player sprite (partially done)
  * Player vs wall collision detection (partially done)
  * Remove those nasty textures (finished - sorta)
  * Wall collision sounds
  * Networking support
  * Chat window, speech.

Outline from Parallel Realities SDL tut #7. Code rearranged for my needs,
and built upon.

This software is released under the LGPLv2+, and is not shipped with ANY 
KIND of warranty.

Have fun!
