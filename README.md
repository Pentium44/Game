Maetrox - Multi-directional 2D game.

How to compile:
  * You need to have SDL installed, specifically the image, mixer, and ttf modules.
  * Simply run the 'configure' shell script then type 'make'. A binary named 'game' will be created.

To-do:
  * Multi-directional animated player sprite (finished)
  * Player vs wall collision detection (Working, in dev)
  * Remove those nasty textures (Partially finished)
  * Walking animations (finished)
  * SDL font library incorporated into the engine (finished)
  * Sounds (Working but not operational)
  * Networking support
  * Chat window, speech.

Textures:
 * Player textures done by iceblue007 (deviantart)
 * Ground textures, so far, done by me.
 
Audio:
 * Walking sound effects made by Yo Frankie! (Blender Foundation)
